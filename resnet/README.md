This model tells you what's in an image. It's a good example of a deep learning model that's small enough to run without a GPU if you're demoing it.

## Usage

First, make sure you've got the [latest version of Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog#install) installed.

Then run predictions on the model:

```sh
cog predict -i image=@hotdog.png
```
