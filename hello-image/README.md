# Hello image

This simple model takes no input and returns a static image.

## Usage

First, make sure you've got the [latest version of Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog#install) installed.

Build the container image:

```sh
cog build
```

Now you can run predictions on the model:

```sh
cog predict
```
