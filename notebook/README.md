# notebook

A simple example using a Jupyter Notebook with Cog

## Usage

First, make sure you've got the [latest version of Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog#install) installed.

Build the image:

```sh
cog build
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook server with Cog:

```sh
cog run -p 8888 --debug jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=mytoken
```

Copy the notebook URL to your browser (you can change the `mytoken` to your preferred token or have it autogenerated):

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=mytoken
```

Save any changes you make to your notebook, then export it as a Python script:

```sh
jupyter nbconvert --to script my_notebook.ipynb # creates my_notebook.py
```

Now you can run predictions on the model:

```sh
cog predict -i name=Alice
```
